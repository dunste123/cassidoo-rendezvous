# Design a simplified version of Twitter, where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow others,
# and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the userâ€™s news feed.
#
# Some useful functions to include would be
# getNewsFeed(userid), postTweet(userid, tweet), follow(follower, followee), and unfollow(follower, followee).
