# Build a very simple text editor.
# Your editor should contain an empty string S at first,
# and have the functions append(t) (add t to the end of S), delete(n) (delete the last n characters of S),
# undo() (revert S to the state it was before an append or delete),
# as well as any other functions you might want to include.
